# Iliade-CO2-O2 evolution version
Integration of O2 and CO2 measurements

## USAGE
The application is made of two phases:
 - CO2 and TSG interpolation
 - CO2 interpolated and O2

First, you have to run
>> interpTSG_CO2

- The first file you have to choose is the CO2 file
- The second is the .tsgqc file : the thermosalinograph output file
- The program will produce 8 figures and ask you where you want to save the TSG/CO2 interpolation

When it's done, you can then run
>> interpAll 

- The first file you have to choose is the previous interpolation result
- The second is the .oxy file : the optode output file
- The program will ask you where you want to save the CO2/TSG/O2 interpolation

interpAll will internally call interpCo2_O2 and correctO2Data

## UNIT TESTS

You can run all the tests from the project folder with
>> runtests('tests')

For more details about them, move yourself to the tests folder by running the following command in the command prompt:
>> cd tests

then, run
>> ls

The following file should be there :
* TestFiles.m
* TFigureProperties.m

### Reading module : TestFiles
This fie test the following functions
- readAsciiO2
- readInterpTSG_CO2
- writeInterpolation (WIP)

You can run all testFiles tests with :

>> runtests('TestFiles')

or a specific test of the file : 

>> runtests('TestFiles','ProcedureName','readCo2')

the results is :
